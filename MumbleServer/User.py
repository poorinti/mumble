@dataclass
class User:
    """
    A connected user.
    
    Attributes
    ----------
    session : int
        Session ID. This identifies the connection to the server.
    userid : int
        User ID. -1 if the user is anonymous.
    mute : bool
        Is user muted by the server?
    deaf : bool
        Is user deafened by the server? If true, this implies mute.
    suppress : bool
        Is the user suppressed by the server? This means the user is not muted, but does not have speech privileges in the current channel.
    prioritySpeaker : bool
        Is the user a priority speaker?
    selfMute : bool
        Is the user self-muted?
    selfDeaf : bool
        Is the user self-deafened? If true, this implies mute.
    recording : bool
        Is the User recording? (This flag is read-only and cannot be changed using setState().)
    channel : int
        Channel ID the user is in. Matches ``Channel.id``.
    name : str
        The name of the user.
    onlinesecs : int
        Seconds user has been online.
    bytespersec : int
        Average transmission rate in bytes per second over the last few seconds.
    version : int
        Legacy client version.
    version2 : int
        New client version. (See https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble/issues/5827)
    release : str
        Client release. For official releases, this equals the version. For snapshots and git compiles, this will be something else.
    os : str
        Client OS.
    osversion : str
        Client OS Version.
    identity : str
        Plugin Identity. This will be the user's unique ID inside the current game.
    context : str
        Base64-encoded Plugin context. This is a binary blob identifying the game and team the user is on.
        
        The used Base64 alphabet is the one specified in RFC 2045.
        
        Before Mumble 1.3.0, this string was not Base64-encoded. This could cause problems for some Ice
        implementations, such as the .NET implementation.
        
        If you need the exact string that is used by Mumble, you can get it by Base64-decoding this string.
        
        If you simply need to detect whether two users are in the same game world, string comparisons will
        continue to work as before.
    comment : str
        User comment. Shown as tooltip for this user.
    address : bytes
        Client address.
    tcponly : bool
        TCP only. True until UDP connectivity is established.
    idlesecs : int
        Idle time. This is how many seconds it is since the user last spoke. Other activity is not counted.
    udpPing : float
        UDP Ping Average. This is the average ping for the user via UDP over the duration of the connection.
    tcpPing : float
        TCP Ping Average. This is the average ping for the user via TCP over the duration of the connection.

        The Slice compiler generated this dataclass from Slice struct ``::MumbleServer::User``.
